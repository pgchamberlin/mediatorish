## JS Mediator

### An example of a mediator in JavaScript, using require.js and Jasmine

This is just a small piece of code to demonstrate using a mediator to handle event subscriptions and delegate the appropriate work to its colleague objects. To see how it works take a look at the spec in js/spec/mediator.js, or clone this repo and navigate to SpecRunner.html.
